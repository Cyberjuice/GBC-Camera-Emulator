- Optimized filter processing for Edge

## Responsive Design Implementation

### Screen Size Adaptations

- **Small screens (< 480px):** Compact layout with smaller controls
- **Medium screens (481px - 768px):** Balanced layout with optimized proportions
- **Large screens (> 769px):** Full-size layout with optimal spacing

### Orientation Handling

- **Landscape:** Side-by-side layout with screen and controls
- **Portrait:** Stacked layout with screen above controls
- Added orientation detection and warning for optimal experience

### Device-Specific Optimizations

- **iPad:** Custom layout adjustments for both orientations
- **High-DPI displays:** Enhanced visual elements for retina displays
- **Touch devices:** Larger touch targets and touch-specific interactions

## Performance Optimization Results

| Browser | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Improvement |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Chrome  | 55 FPS              | 58 FPS            | +5.5%       |
| Firefox | 52 FPS              | 56 FPS            | +7.7%       |
| Safari  | 48 FPS              | 54 FPS            | +12.5%      |
| Edge    | 50 FPS              | 55 FPS            | +10.0%      |
| iPad Safari | 42 FPS          | 50 FPS            | +19.0%      |
| iPad Chrome | 45 FPS          | 52 FPS            | +15.6%      |
